              I am currently pursuing my Computer Science degree specialised in
              Data Science at GL Bajaj Institute of Technology and Management,
              Greater Noida.

              As a C++ and Fullstack Developer in training, I enjoy solving
              complex problems with C++, building scalable backend systems with
              Spring Boot, designing responsive frontends with React, and
              integrating databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL. I focus on
              writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code.

              I am passionate about learning new technologies and applying them
              in real-world projects. Through my work, I aim to create
              meaningful, user-friendly applications.
